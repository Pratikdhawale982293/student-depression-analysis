# Student Depression Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **depression trends among students** using **Python-based data analytics techniques**.  
The objective is to understand key factors influencing student mental health through **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**.

Mental health issues among students are increasing due to academic pressure, lifestyle changes, and social factors. This project aims to extract **meaningful insights** from data to help identify **patterns, risk factors, and trends** related to student depression.

## Objectives
- Analyze student depression data using Python  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Identify patterns and correlations affecting mental health  
- Visualize insights using graphs and charts  
- Draw conclusions that can support awareness and early intervention  

## Problem Statement
Student depression is a serious concern impacting **academic performance and overall well-being**.
By analyzing structured datasets, this project aims to:
- Understand contributing factors  
- Identify high-risk groups  
- Provide data-driven insights for better decision-making  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and experimentation
  
## Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Student mental health dataset  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values and inconsistencies  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Statistical summaries and distributions  
4. **Visualization** – Graphs to identify patterns and trends  
5. **Insights & Conclusion** – Interpretation of results  

## Key Analysis Performed
- Distribution of depression levels among students  
- Impact of academic pressure and lifestyle factors  
- Gender and age-based comparison  
- Correlation between mental health indicators
